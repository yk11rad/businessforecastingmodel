Business Sales Forecasting Model

Overview
--------
This notebook implements a robust time series forecasting model to predict monthly sales (in £) for a retail business using synthetic data. The model leverages SARIMA with grid search for parameter selection, cross-validation, probabilistic forecasts, and advanced diagnostics, making it suitable for business applications and portfolio showcasing.

Features
--------
- Synthetic Data: 5 years of monthly sales with trend, growing seasonality, noise, and promotional spikes.
- EDA: Stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS), decomposition, ACF/PACF plots.
- Model: SARIMA with grid search for optimal parameters.
- Diagnostics: Residual analysis (Q-Q plot, Ljung-Box, Shapiro-Wilk, ARCH test).
- Forecasting: 12-month forecast for 2025 with standard and simulated confidence intervals.
- Evaluation: Cross-validation (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and comparison to a seasonal naive baseline.
- Visualizations: Error distribution, cumulative sales, and actual vs fitted plots.

Setup
-----
- Environment: Google Colab (Python 3).
- Libraries: Installed automatically (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `arch`).
- Execution: Run all cells sequentially.

Outputs
-------
- Plots: Saved in `/content/` (e.g., `synthetic_sales.png`, `forecast.png`, `actual_vs_fitted.png`).
- Files:
  - `model_summary.txt`: SARIMA model details.
  - `sales_forecast_2025.csv`: Forecast table.
  - `forecast_summary.txt`: Comprehensive summary with metrics and diagnostics.
- Console: Displays diagnostics, metrics, and forecast.

Usage
-----
1. Run the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Inspect plots and console outputs.
3. Download files from `/content/` for reporting (e.g., via Colab’s file explorer).
4. Modify synthetic data parameters (e.g., trend, spikes) for experimentation.

Notes
-----
- Currency is British Pounds (£) for UK context.
- Code is modular and extensible (e.g., add exogenous variables for SARIMAX).
- Optimized for Colab with minimal setup, avoiding pmdarima to prevent binary incompatibility.
- Cross-validation errors may be high due to promotional spikes; consider outlier handling for improved metrics.
